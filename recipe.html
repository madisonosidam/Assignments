 <!-- Main Recipe -->
            <div id="main">
                <h3>Directions</h3>
                <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter and our two 8-by-2-inch cake pans,
tapping out excess our. In a medium bowl, whisk our, baking powder,
baking soda, salt, and lemon zest.</p>
<p>In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat butter and 1 1/2 cups sugar
until light and fluffy. With mixer on low, beat in eggs and yolks, one at a
time. Beat in 2 tablespoons lemon juice. Alternately beat in our mixture
and buttermilk beginning and ending with our mixture; mix just until combined.</p>
<p>Divide batter between pans; smooth tops. Bake until cakes pull away from
sides of pans, 32 to 35 minutes. Let cool in pans 10 minutes. Run a knife
around edges of pans and invert cakes onto a wire rack.</p>
<p> While cakes are baking, bring remaining 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup water to
a boil in a saucepan. Add lemon slices and simmer 25 minutes. Using a
slotted spoon, transfer lemon slices to a waxed-paper-lined plate. Stir
remaining 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice into syrup.</p>
<p>Using a toothpick, poke holes in warm cakes on rack. Brush with lemon
syrup. Let cool completely. Prepare frosting, substituting 2 tablespoons
fresh lemon juice for vanilla extract. Frost cooled cakes and top with
candied lemon slices.</p>
